I almost didn't buy it because I thought It would be too difficult to drag myself through all of the game specific terminology since I don't play the game. I was WRONG. Dan Abnett truly tells a compelling, in-depth, page turner of a story that's 1 part Sherlock Holmes, 1 part Raiders of the Lost Ark, and 1 part Lovecraft's Cthulu. The Eisenhorn Ominbus edition covers all three books and 2 chronlogically organized short stories.   I just chucked Dune and Starhship Troopers off my bookshelf. Eisenhorn deserves to stand alone at the top of the SF heap. My best comparison is LOTR. This is a definite buy-it-in-hardback-if-you-can-find-it so it can endure the wear of re-reading.	2005-10-13

Where Warhammer was confined by its late medieval setting, 40K gets to indulge a smorgasbord of historical flavours - Imperial Rome, Victorian England, 20th century fascism - while keeping Elves, Orcs and other medieval fantasy staples, only adding spaceships and guns. Hardcore science-fiction buffs may sniff as such quarrying of the past as intellectually lazy and tacky, but that's their loss. As expected of a 40K novel, Eisenhorn is not exactly a light read. Occasional scenes of poetic charm and even beauty relieve a sea of grimness, in which most characters eventually die with varying degrees of unpleasantness. It seems to be the First Law of Science Fiction - the more dystopian the universe, the more readers relate to people living in it - and Abnett, who's perhaps better known for his work on the 2000AD (Judge Dredd) franchise, is an old hand at this. I can't think of a novel that better captures the baroque and sometimes frankly disturbing appeal of Warhammer 40000.	2005-07-24

It is also cheaper to buy the larger version than the books individually.   Warhammer 40k universe is very grim, dark, and compelling to read with other fine series of books written by William King and Ben Counter.	2005-07-05

Eisenhorn, as the collected works are now known is the quite possibly best of Dan Abnett's work. Originally published as three separate paper-back novels named Xenos, Malleus, and Hereticus this new edition includes the unabridged contents of those three books as well as two \\"arching\\" short stories of about twenty pages that connect books one to two and two to three.  This is an amazingly opportunity.  Abnett's setting and visuals almost leap out of the page and his characterization and storytelling is not only the best in the Black Library but one of the best in genre.  Part Tom Clancy and part Robert Jordon, Abnett's tale of Gregor Eisenhorn from age 30 to nearly three hundred is a magnificent experience both sinister and sublime. You will not be disappointed.	2005-06-15
